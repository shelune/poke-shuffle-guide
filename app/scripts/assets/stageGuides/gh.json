		"clearingStrategy": "The problem here is the high amount of HP of the stage. The disruption is not that bad, so a Pyre team with M-Blaziken can work and clear it itemless with a bit of luck. Other options include M-Garchomp, and M-Rayquaza can do some work despite being not very effective. If you're not using Disruption Delay, it is advisable to bring a Block Smash+ user, since it can get rid of the blocks in a single activation. ",
