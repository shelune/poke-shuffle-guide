What you\nplay it with may vary.\n\nC-1, Mega Start, Moves +5 with M-Aero.\nThat works apprently well from the \nfeedback I gathered. You can go M-Aero\nwith Skyblast team, or Pyre. Both should\nbe fine.\n\nElse, there is the bit more expensive option\nwith full items, using M-Ray and either\nSkyblast or Pyre team. It's 1500 coins more\nthan the previous option, but I think it is\nsafer thanks to the better combo potential.\n\nFull item run with Rayquaza, Reshiram,\nHo-Oh and Delphox is super safe. 4 moves\nover the S rank, and I did not even have\ngreat combos.",
